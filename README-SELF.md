## üß© System Architecture

- Each portal (Customer, Admin, Sales Manager, Staff) is hosted separately for role-specific access.

- Backend services may optionally be managed via a centralized controller (could be a dedicated Laravel backend or middleware API).
- Plan B: Use Docker + phpMyAdmin for database setup and direct integration.
